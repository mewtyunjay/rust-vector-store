# From Scratch

ðŸš§ **Work In Progress** ðŸš§

Implementing embeddings and vector storage from first principles.

## Project Structure

- **`python-embeddings/`** - Python implementation for generating and working with embeddings
- **`rust-vector-store/`** - Rust implementation of a vector database/storage system

## Goals

- [ ] Implement embeddings generation and manipulation from scratch
- [ ] Build a vector store from first principles in Rust
- [ ] Integrate Python embeddings with Rust vector storage
- [ ] Implement similarity search and retrieval algorithms

## Status

This project is in early development. Both components are being built from the ground up using first principles.
